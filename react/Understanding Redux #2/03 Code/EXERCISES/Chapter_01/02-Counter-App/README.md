So, as in previous exercises, you need to refactor the state to be managed via Redux.

There's one more thing you may not have noticed.

The select tag which sets the activeSession in state is managed via React as well i.e it's a controlled component.

You'll need to refactor that to work with Redux as well.

Read through my solution (code), with the knowledge of previous exercises, I'm sure you'll make sense of it.
